abstract = {When Los Angeles is mentioned, cycling is usually not the first thing that comes to mind. However, during my past 10 years in LA studying molecular biology and bioinformatics, my bike trips through the geographical space of LA have inspired many ideas in my research in spatial data analysis in bioinformatics. I have written software to bring decades of research in geospatial data analysis to spatial -omics, as my trips make me ponder on spatial phenomena in general.},
